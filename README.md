# lab_report_sem-5-
This is the lab report of semester 5 where i solve the different lab of cryptography,desgin and analysis of algorithm 
In cryptography following are the lab report title 
1. Ceaser cipher
2. hill cipher
3. railfence cipher
4. multicative inverse of a number over galois field
5. Miller - Rabin Primility test
6. checking primitive root of prime number
7. Diffie_hellman key exchange algorithm
8. RSA key generation, encryption and decryption


Similarly in design and analysis of algorith the title is here:
1. buble_sort with their empirical analaysis
2. selection_sort with their empirical analaysis
3. insertion_sort with their empirical analaysis
4. heap sort
5. finding min max in array using divide and conquer approach
6. Quck sort
7. cost of multiplication using matrix chain multiplication
